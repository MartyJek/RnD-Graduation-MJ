## Research Question Minor:
>How can I amplify awareness of sustainability issues regarding the growth-orientation of the ICT industry through the application of [[ecomedia]] and salvage fabrication practices in the field of audiovisual design based on permacomputing principles?

"This research question has been developed to incorporate the goal of the project, which is to not only to understand how I can personally benefit from concepts of sustainable computer practices but also, how I can communicate the problematizing aspects of the current ICT industry."


From a feedback session with Aymeric I came to the conclusion that i should return to my major work and implement permacomputing principles and techniques into the workflow. But this is not enough for me. I would like to experiment with the notion to create Ecomedia that depicts the environment through media. The questions I am asking myself now are:
- How do I create a story that criticises maximalist ICT?
- How do I engage multiple audiences on a nerdy topic? Relatability? Humour?
