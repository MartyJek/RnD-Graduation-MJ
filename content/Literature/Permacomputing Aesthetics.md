> Permacomputing could therefore be an effective cultural counter-voice to a digital aesthetic that encourages maximisation, e.g. high bandwidth, high resolution, more computing power at any cost, for anything, sensing and capturing more, while making less and less sense, ultimately rendering us insensitive to the harm and damage we legitimise

# Abstract

[[Permacomputing]] is a nascent concept and a community of practice centred around ==design principles that embrace limits and constraints as a positive thing in computational culture, and on creativity with scarce computational resources.==As a result, permacomputing aims to provide a countervoice to digital practices that promote maximisation, hyper-consumption and waste. It seeks to ==encourage practices as an applied critique of contemporary computer technology that privileges maximalist aesthetics== where more pixels, more frame rate, more computation and more power equals more potential at any cost and without any consequences. We believe that such a critical practice can be relevant to artists, designers and cultural practitioners working with computer and network tech-nology who are interested in engaging with environmental issues. This is particularly relevant given the tendency in art, design and cultural production to rely on tools and techniques designed to maximise productivity and mass consumption.
In this paper, we argue for the potential of ==permacomputing as a rich framework for exploring creative design constraints== building on a long history of applying constraints in art, design and cultural practices. Because of the need to reconfigure the modes of production and organisation within computational practices, this calls for a ==different understanding of aesthetics, one that goes beyond the formal evaluation of how things look, but addresses how aesthetics can also be systems of relations, sensing and making sense that are already present in the process of making.== We will also discuss the challenges faced by permacomputing practitioners, such as the complicated link with retro-computing, post-digital culture and nostalgia, as well as the problem of constraints in relation to the aesthetisation of poverty, and more generally what it means to work with self-imposed limits in a more privileged socioeconomic context.

# 2 Deceptive Maximalist Techno-Aesthetics

>Gilbert Simondon describes a techno-aesthetic work as “perfectly functional, successful, and beautiful,” where contemplation and joy arise from the fusion of aesthetics and technique. Simondon also points out that aesthetics cannot be reduced to the sensations felt by the consumer of a work. It also encompasses the sensations of the person who crafts, makes and creates the artifact, as well as the relationships with the instruments used in the process.

>But while we are stuck in this modern adaptation of Zeno’s paradoxes, we continue to record, collect and archive a mesmerising amount of digital data in which we forget ourselves,[2] and why we are doing such things in the first place.

>So when we talk about permacomputing aesthetics, it is not just about technical implementation, or about countering a broken maximalism with an exact opposite, such as an equally broken minimalism. It is about reimagining, dreaming, and experimenting with alternative ways of engaging with computer and network technology.[9] Artists, designers and cultural workers are often praised for their capacity to communicate, illustrate and raise awareness around social issues. It is up to us to begin to critically examine the ways we are dependent on the ICT industry, to rethink the ways in which they produce things, and to begin to address this on a practical and concrete level in our fields


# 3 Art, Design and Cultural Work under Constraints

## Constraints: *Less is more*

### Examples:

- literary rules of the writers of the [OuLiPo](History of the Lipogram. In Oulipo: A Primer or Potential Literature) collective 
- [conceptual writing ]([monoskop.org/images/3/3c/Dworkin\_Craig\_Goldsmith\_Kenneth\_eds\_Against\_Expression\_An\_Anthology\_of\_Conceptual\_Writing.pdf](https://monoskop.org/images/3/3c/Dworkin_Craig_Goldsmith_Kenneth_eds_Against_Expression_An_Anthology_of_Conceptual_Writing.pdf))
- minimalism in music and visual art;
- any notated work to be performed, executed, installed, manifested again, such as poetry, music, graphic scores, conceptual art, performance art, installation art, software and computational art. [^1]
- [choice of technology used: early computer artists in the late 1960s and early 70s working out programs for plotters without screens](Zsofi Valyi-Nagy. 2022. Vera Molnar: Weaving Variations. https://www.holo.mg/ dossiers/vera-molnar-weaving-variations/)
- subsets of the demoscene subculture that focus on making extremely small audiovisual programs or deliberately use old and limited hardware platforms
- choice of ‘poor’ materials: arte povera in Italy in the 1960s, using materials such as wood, earth, scrap metal and industrial waste; making furniture from common sizes of construction wood
- found industrial materials; making household objects from available small trees and branches in Slöjd
- working with E-waste
- working with [[Low-tech magazine | limited availability of hardware and energy]]


>More generally, self-imposed constraints in this context become facilitators and amplifiers of creativity, so it is also possible to refer to them as [fabric](http://viznut.fi/texts-en/fabric_theory.html), or to [redirect the discussion](https://conditionaldesign.org/ manifesto/) by [emphasising the process](https://valiz.nl/en/publications/conditional-design-workbook).

## Political & external constraints

### Examples

- Building your own server and denying the comfort of Cloud-products
- unofficial artists during ‘normalisation’ in Czechoslovakia (1970s-1980s) and elsewhere retreated from public space and galleries to nature and private homes, and to media such as concept, action, performance, land art and video, such as the dissident video magazine Original Videojournal, which was secretly edited and copied on school equipment. 
- working within restrictive copyright or uncertain legal status: 1970s ephemeral media circulation in Cuba; low-resolution bootleg videos on UbuWeb; shadow and bootleg libraries. 
- constraints can be socio-economic: Soviet Constructivists using wood and scrap metal because other art supplies were scarce; 1970s artists using discarded materials to produce their work [quickly and cheaply](https://americanart.si.edu/blog/recycling-revolution-alternativemedia-chicanx-protest-art)
- ‘Free Furniture’ design ideas from the 1971 Steal This Book work by American political and osocial activist [Abbie Hoffman;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steal_This_Book)
- [Gambiarra in Brazil](https://www.makery.info/en/2015/03/31/gambiarra-la-culture-de-la-reparation/)
- [Jugaaḍ](), applied to concrete problems by repurposing objects and with limited resources, including the unexpected reconfiguration of media saturation in South Asia

## So, 

>what would it mean to address the urgency to the point of completely reconfiguring a practice? Is it dilettantism? Virtue signalling? Artivism? Or just a symbolic gesture?

# 4 Permacomputing Aesthetics

>What distinguishes permacomputing from other approaches is the way in which it makes constraints visible and usable through its connection to material circumscription.

>Unlike Simondon’s techno-aesthetics, which may eventually iteratively find a pleasing equilibrium between functional technique and aesthetics, permacomputing’s techno-aesthetics are much more perilous because **a third component is forced in: an informed and contextualised intention to address the social, cultural, environmental and economic externalities of maximalist computer and network technologies.**

>==permacomputing aesthetics should not be misunderstood as belonging to an aesthetics of obstruction, for it is less concerned with the performative and symbolic dimension of its approach,[10] and is **instead rooted in questioning the nature of its underlying process and the generative insecurity of its awkwardness.**== [Femke Snelting: Awkward Gestures](https://freeze.sh/_/2008/awkward/#)

>In practice, permacomputing exists as two intertwined strands: first, an incentive to reuse and repurpose existing computer technology and materials to create new works; and second, a list of continuously evolving design principles, to guide that very reuse and repurposing, but also to inform the development of new software and hardware when reuse and repurposing are not possible or relevant.


# 5 Permacomputing and Nostalgia

>In societies vastly dominated by technological novelty, economic growth, and technosolutionism, [[Reinventing how we use computers#We don’t have computers anymore. We have content consuming devices.|the relationship with time is difficult to dissociate from consumerism.]]

>At the same time, there is an important aspect of retro-computing activities that can also challenge this argument: technical accessibility. It should not be underestimated that for many hackers, artists, designers and modders, the appeal of retro-computing lies in the relatively low-threshold capacity to augment, adapt or tinker with old equipment. From discrete components, socketed chips, annotated PCB layouts, and thick service manuals and schematics, retro-computing turns the maximalist notion of computational potential on its head. Even if everything is relative, and that black boxes of the past are just as closed as those of today, old machines are simply easier to take apart and understand. So if permacomputing could be aligned with retro-computing, it would be through some of the retro-computing subcultures that use so-called obsolete technology in radically different contexts because of its plasticity

>In addition to technical considerations, permacomputing also resonates with the creative and environmental considerations of zombie media —a counterpoint to the notion of dead media—which acknowledges that “[m]edia kills nature as they remain as living deads”, and encourages the reappropriation of electronic waste, drawing an analogy with the processes of reuse found in remix culture.
> ==SEE ALSO==: [[In Defense of the Poor Image]]

>Ultimately, permacomputing aesthetics could be understood as a politically driven kind of post-digital aesthetics [lab404.com/142/cramer.pdf](https://lab404.com/142/cramer.pdf)




# Reflection

In a near vengeful tone the authors of this piece strip apart the term of maximalist [[On Techno-Aesthetics| techno-aesthetics]]: "Aesthetics, that are the manifestation of technologies driven by the myth of perpetual growth and infinite resources, aesthetics based on the everincreasing complexity and resource consumption of digital devices that seek to justify growth through self-referential legitimisation, regardless of necessity or ability to even function properly". They criticize corporate greed and the maximalist idea that growth is a form of progress. Permacomputing, a combination of the words Permaculture and computing, seeks to be a practical framework that encourages limits and constraints in computer culture and creativity. In my own practices I've fallen into the trap of '[[The trap of mesmerizing aesthetics|mesmerizing aesthetics]]', creating beautiful (but shallow) 3D CGI artwork that goes into a similar direction of ignorant (towards climate crisis, overconsumption) maximisation. In the name of Permacomputing I am trying to reframe my practices into purposeful aesthetics with self-imposed constraints.

"Computationally minimal art (CMA) can be described as an algorithmic art that idealizes low computational complexity as a source of beauty." The simplicity of CMA in it's own process-making can be defined as an aesthetics. 
Like mentioned in the abstract: "... a different understanding of aesthetics, one that goes beyond the formal evaluation of how things look, but addresses how aesthetics can also be systems of relations, sensing and making sense that are already present in the process of making". 

This goes hand-in-hand with Simondons choice of a techno-asesthetic work: One that is functional, successful, and beautiful. And more so: The set of sensoric pleasure that goes with using a technically successful tool.
